# ðŸš€ Automating Deployments with GitHub Actions ðŸš€

Our blog is now fully automated using **GitHub Actions**! Every time a change is pushed to the `main` branch, the blog:
1. **Builds** with Hugo.
2. **Deploys** to the cloud automatically.

This means no manual stepsâ€”just seamless updates whenever content is ready!

More details on the setup are coming soon. Stay tuned! ðŸŽ‰
